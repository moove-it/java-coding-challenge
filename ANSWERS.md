## A - The entities

 I decided to represent the Models and Submodels in the same entity (CAR_MODEL), since
 they are essentially the same object but are used to represent different levels of cars.
 Likewise, this model would give us vertical scalability of the data, if there is a new 
 level for cars in the future.

## B - Ingest the data

## C - Expose data with a RESTful API

## D - Adding images

## E - Improvements
